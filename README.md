 # #Frontend Challenge
 ## Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page

 Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can use any language of your choice.

# The Challenge
The challenge was to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. However, I made a few changes to my design. 

Users should be able to:
1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size. ❌ I had a little challenge in responsive web.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. ❌ Here is where I made a few changes to mine.
3. Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
 - The `input` field is empty.✅
 - The email address is not formatted correctly.✅
 
 I managed to do part three, however mine is not anywhere close to the design 😂😪. Tough times.


# How I went about this challenge
1. I looked through the design and started planning out how I will tackle the project.
2. I structured the contented with HTML the added the styles with CSS, then the email validation with Javascript.
3. I initialized the project as a public repository on Github.
 

 Finally, I deployed the project on GitHub Pages 😊
